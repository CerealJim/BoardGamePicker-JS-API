## Board Game Picker
The objective is to generate a selection of 9 boardgames based off of user input on 3 specific criteria: # of players, max time per game, minimum age.
The gallery output displays the game title, game picture, selection criteria and when hovered over with the cursor, a game description and button to find more information at gameboardAtlas.

## How It's Made!
This application is created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I used [boardgameatlas API](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs) to fetch and display boardgame data.  I made this app to challenge myself and showcase my knowledge of Javascript while taking the Javascript course at Juno College.
